## About the project
This project was bootstrapped with create-react-app, and was built with a lot of assumptions about what certain elements of the provided UI design would do if they weren't all lorem-ipsum.

I tried breaking out disctint functionalities into separate components, thus they can be easily reused and tested.

I did not implement any responsiveness due to time constraints and lack of designs.
